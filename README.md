# Native Array Methods: Map, Filter, Reduce

## Objectives

* Explain the use case for native array methods
  - map
  - filter
  - reduce
* Write map, filter, and reduce functions
* Identify the parts of a native array method

## Notes

* Explain the use case for native array methods
  - map:
    * returns a new array of the same length as input array
    * apply our code to every item in the input array
    * often some kind of data transformation or manipulation
  - filter:
    * looks for a specific thing in array and keeps it or not
    * involves a test
    * returns a new array of equal or LESSER length than the input array
    * filter out items from the original array based on our test/condition
    * generally want to remove things from the array
  - reduce:
    * doesn't automatically return a new array
    * returns a new value (string, number, object, array)
    * often reducing into a single value
